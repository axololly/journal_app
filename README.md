# Melon Slice: a Journal App made with Flutter.

I decided, after two days of working on this project, it was finally a good time to open a repository so I can keep track of the progress I have on this project.

> :hammer_and_wrench: This project is Windows only!

## Progress Update

Currently, all I have is a custom title bar, and I've started work on creating the sidebar with the entries. Eventually, I'll use `flutter_quill`

## Visual Schema

If you want to see my blueprint for this project, just take a look [here](https://www.figma.com/design/HXNveuNYguBTzNpDMvbdP5/i-hate-UI-design-%5BDiary-UI-5%5D?node-id=5-106&t=1IjUcqhWIWiHZ7J2-1) at this Figma page - this is my entire design. It would be interesting to get some feedback, but that is where it is now.

## Thanks

Thank you to the (unofficial) Flutter Discord server and its members for continuing to be so helpful. You can join their server [here](https://discord.gg/rflutterdev).

That's all for now. :thumbsup:
