Sigh.

A new day of school. Not really anyone's favourite day of the year.

I repetitively exhale, attempting to calm the storm of nerves inside me.

"Grace! You can come in now!"

My heart pulses rapidly. Realising my name has been called, I raise my hand to turn the door knob, but it won't budge. I release my grip from the centre of the knob and rotate it to face me.

Sweat. So much sweat. I attempt to breathe in again to compose my anxiousness but it refrains from calming down. Hesitantly, after wiping my hands on my discoloured jumper, I lift hand hand again to rotate the door handle while the teacher glares at me with eyes which ask why I'm taking so long to complete such a simple task.

As I finally hear the door unlock, a mouthful of saliva slides down my throat and my quivering feet take a few steps forward.

The classroom was a dull grey colour with a pearly white ceiling. Of course it wasn't as vibrant as I was expecting , as it had that stereotypical appearance and smell of an ordinary classroom: posters all over the walls (including the ones irrelevant to the subject); the stench of students (specifically boys [edit: no offence to the majority ðŸ˜­]) after a PE lesson. As I fought the urge to clog my nostrils with the cotton sleeves of my jumper, the teacher asks me to introduce myself. 

As I was hesitant to speak, I explicitly observed everyone's faces as they patiently awaited my chorded gasps, the tension palpable in the air. But in the back corner, lay a face that clearly contrasted with the uninviting atmosphere of this room. Sunlit eyes glared at me with a sense of genuineness, embracing me with comfort, telling me 'everything will be alright'. I couldn't help but feel my cheekbones rise and sculpt a 'socially-awkward but sincere' smile on my face. A wave of calm enveloped me, soothing every neve, and I was comfortably able to introduce myself. I was then told so sit opposite to the boy at the back corner. I smiled. 

As I trotted towards the back of the classroom, one step at a time, I unintentionally entangle my foot with my shoelace. Only if I fell as gracefully as my name. 

I thought my well-earned confidence had been extracted from my heart, until I looked up. His sincere smile crossed my eyes and an unfamiliar warmth spread throughout my body. I stood back up with caution and found my empty seat.

As the teacher continued to talk, my gaze remained on him. His authentic appearance increased my desire to befriend him. I wanted to know him better.

Time passed. So much time that the bell rang and I came back to my senses. The familiar smell and dull appearance of the room flooded back into my memory. The boy stood up. I was tempted to ask for his name, but time was a thief. The moments I spent contemplating and fighting my nerves  gave him enough time to exit the classroom, diligently heading towards his next class.
